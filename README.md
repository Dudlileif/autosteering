# AgOpenGps - Flutter port

Original source [AgOpenGps](https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS).

This is a prototype/concept port of the AgOpenGps software. The goal is to explore an option to
make the program cross-platform and possibly run on cheaper or more available hardware than Windows tablets/computers.

By using flutter we can also get a more modern UI system, and
perhaps create something more intuitive and customizable.
