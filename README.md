# Autosteering - Built with Flutter

This is a prototype/concept program inspired by the [AgOpenGps](https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS) software. The goal is to explore an option to
make the program cross-platform and possibly run on cheaper or more available hardware than Windows tablets/computers.

By using flutter we can also get a more modern UI system, and
perhaps create something more intuitive and customizable.
