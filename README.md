# Autosteering - Built with Flutter

This is a prototype/concept program inspired by the [AgOpenGps](https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS) software. The goal is to create a cross-platform option that can run on cheaper or more available hardware than Windows tablets/computers. With Flutter this program can run on Android, Windows, Linux and Apple devices (not tested, probably needs some configuration). A web version also exists primarily for demonstration purpose, but it has quite reduced performance due to lack of multithreading and doesn't support hardware communication.
